			<p> During the summer of 2017, I worked as the <strong>Outreach Intern</strong> for The International City/County Management Association (ICMA), a nonprofit organization that offers a wide range of services to its members of local governments. I was directly involved in researching and writing copy for several social media initiatives. I conducted extensive research, organized a feedback form to assist in the development of a FAQ section and wrote a statistical report that analyzed survey responses from members. Furthermore, I developed blog posts that covered a range of topics, including highlights from survey reports, a guide on navigating a new website, an archive of pertinent resources, and local government success stories. Through this internship experience, my writing, research, analytical, and communication skills greatly increased. 
			</p>
			<p> Prior to my ICMA internship, I worked as a <strong>Development Assistant</strong> at The Treatment and Learning Centers (TLC), a nonprofit organization whose mission is to improve the lives of individuals with disabilities. As a development assistant, I aided in the planning and execution of multiple events, such as the 25th Annual Golf Classic, Road Rally, Fall Luncheon, and 5K Race. For these events, I created and designed promotional and informational material, researched and solicited sponsorship opportunities. Through this experience, I improved my software, research, design, organization, and planning skills. TLC asked me to return during the following winter to assist with additional projects and events.
